# twitter-airflow-data-engineering-project
This project builds a data pipeline that extracts tweets from the Twitter (X) API v2, transforms them into a structured format with Pandas, stores them in Amazon S3, and makes them queryable with AWS Athena. The entire pipeline is automated and scheduled using Apache Airflow running on AWS EC2.
